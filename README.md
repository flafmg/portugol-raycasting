# PortuRay
A raycaster written in Portugol Studio

## Introduction
PortuRay is a project where I created a simple raycaster using Portugol Studio. Portugol Studio is a language designed to teach the basics of programming in Portuguese, not to create complex graphics applications :p.

## Features
- Written in **Portugol Studio**.
- Implements basic raycasting to create a 3D effect from a 2D map.
- Demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of using Portugol Studio for graphics programming. (it is slow as hell)
